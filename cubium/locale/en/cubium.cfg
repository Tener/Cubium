[space-location-description]
cubium=Once upon a time, an Engineer mastered the secrets of the Ultracube. In an exhilaration of cube-induced-madness, he created a second Ultracube. The second cube resonated with the first, creating this celestial body - and one dead engineer.

energized-microcube=A mere fraction of the ultracube, this tool can create Cube jelly.
dormant-microcube=Cube is sleeping. Lazy.
inverted-microcube=A reconstituted microcube, capable of more transformations.
inverted-dormant-microcube=Nappy time is best time.
ultradense-substrate=Pulled from ultradense lava and crystalized with stone, this is useful for creating microcubes.
energized-shards=Fragments of a microcube.
inverted-shards=Inverted microcube fragments, created from smashing microcubes together.
cube-jelly=Transcendental matter created from activating microcubes. Can be converted into useful resources. Tastes like chicken. 
inverted-cube-jelly=Transcendental matter created from activating inverted-microcubes. Can be recycled into sulfur and other resources. HANDLE WITH CAUTION.
destabilized-cube-matter=Cube jelly that is less stable, and almost a dream. Recycles into useful resources.
dream=Tastes like cotton candy. Dissolve in water to make liquid dream.
